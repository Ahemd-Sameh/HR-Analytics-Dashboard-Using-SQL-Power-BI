Objective:
Develop a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard to provide insights into various human resource metrics using SQL and 
Power BI.

Tools Used:
SQL: For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

Steps:
Data Collection and Preparation:
Data Extraction:
Utilized SQL to query HR databases and extract relevant data including employee demographics, job details, department 
information, and location data.
Data Transformation:
Cleaned and transformed the data using SQL. This included handling missing values, normalizing data formats, and 
aggregating data as required.
Data Loading:
Loaded the transformed data into Power BI for visualization.

Dashboard Design and Development:
Gender Distribution:
Created bar charts to display the number of employees by gender categories (Male, Female, Non-Conforming).
Remote vs Headquarters Distribution:
Designed a pie chart to illustrate the percentage of employees working remotely versus at the headquarters.
Race Distribution:
Used bar charts to represent the number of employees across different racial categories.
Employee Count by Department:
Developed a bar chart showing the distribution of employees across various departments with a breakdown by gender.
Employee Distribution by State:
Implemented a map visualization to depict the geographical distribution of employees across different states.
Age Group Distribution:
Created bar charts to show the number of employees in different age groups.
Age Group Distribution by Gender:
Designed gender-specific bar charts for each age group category.
Turnover Rates:
Visualized the turnover rates across different departments using bar charts.
Percentage Hire Change Over Time:
Plotted a line chart to show the percentage change in hires from the year 2000 to 2020.

Visualization and Interaction:
Ensured the dashboard was interactive, allowing users to filter data by different categories such as gender, department, 
and age group.
Implemented tooltips and drill-down features for detailed insights.

Testing and Validation:
Conducted thorough testing to ensure data accuracy and visualization correctness.
Validated the dashboard with stakeholders to ensure it met their requirements and provided actionable insights.

Deployment:
Deployed the dashboard on the Power BI service for easy access and sharing across the organization.

Key Insights:
Gender and Race Diversity: The organization shows a relatively balanced gender distribution but has areas to improve in 
racial diversity.
Remote Work: A significant portion of the workforce is working remotely, highlighting the importance of remote work policies.
Departmental Distribution: Engineering and Accounting departments have the highest number of employees.
Turnover Rates: Certain departments like Auditing and Legal have higher turnover rates, indicating potential areas for 
HR intervention.
Hiring Trends: There has been a steady increase in hiring over the past two decades, reflecting organizational growth.

By following these steps and utilizing the power of SQL for data management and Power BI for visualization, the 
HR analytics dashboard provides valuable insights that can help in strategic decision-making and improving HR processes.
